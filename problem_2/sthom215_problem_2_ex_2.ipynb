    "Load up the calcium image video in the file: $\\texttt{TEST MOVIE 00001-small.tif}$. This file represents the raw fluorescence video in TIF format, but without the motion. One of the most common ways that people analyze functional data is to try to identify individual cells in the data in a “summary image”. A summary image condenses an entire video sequence into a single image, wherein each pixel represents a summary of the entire time-trace at the location of that pixel in the video."
