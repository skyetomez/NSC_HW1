# NSC_HW1  ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains the homework assignments for the course Neural Signals and Computation.

## Homework Assignment

The homework assignments in this repository are designed to provide hands-on experience with neural signal processing and computation. They cover a range of topics, from basic signal processing techniques to advanced computational models.

Each assignment includes a detailed description of the task, along with starter code and test cases. The assignments are designed to be challenging but achievable, and they provide an opportunity to apply the concepts learned in the course.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure is as follows:

- NSC_HW1/
    - README.md
    - (other files and directories related to the homework assignments)

## Note on Implementation

While I have attempted to implement some of the functions required for these assignments myself, I found that my implementations were too slow for practical use. Therefore, I have substituted these functions with equivalent functions from the sklearn library. This has significantly improved the performance of the code, while still achieving the same results.

Please refer to the individual assignment files for more details on which functions have been substituted.
